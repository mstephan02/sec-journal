## Questions

- What are the five Guiding Principles of an SOP?
  - Keep it simple. Keep in mind that especially at the Service Desk, the SOP is likely to be referenced while handling a customer contact. The SOP should augment and reinforce training; it is not a substitute for training.
  -SOPs must be portable. Even if an underpinning application or tool is changed, the “what, when, and why” generally will not. This is why I use work instructions to map the SOP to the underpinning tool.
  -Flowcharts and diagrams tell a story. People learn and interpret information in different ways. Some people like to read about how something should be done, others like to see “the big picture” and then read the details. Having a flowchart or diagrams (as appropriate) is a great way to quickly communicate what activities are addressed within the SOP.
  -Consistency counts. Develop and use a consistent format or template to help make the SOP consumable.
  -It’s about the audience. However you write your SOPs, keep in mind that you’re writing them for your audience. If the SOP does not work for your audience, your SOP doesn’t work. Conduct regular periodic reviews of SOPs with the people that use them to identify and incorporate improvements.
- Which principle do you believe is most important and why?
  - It's about the audience. We need to be able to explain whats going on in terms everyone can understand
- Why are System Images important?
  - They are like a save point in a game. When you die you can start from there so you don't want to go forever without saving.
- Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
  - Don't block port 3389
