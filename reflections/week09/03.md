# Daily Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned today, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges or benefits that you are experiencing working as a team.

## Prompts
- What went well today?
- Are you meeting your daily scrum goals?
- Is the team working well together?
- Do you or the team have any roadblocks?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?
